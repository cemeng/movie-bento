== Movie Bento

It's an online movie rental system - it's started off as a variation from
the project from the book Agile Development with Rails (4th edition).    
    
Aim of the project is to test Rails features and other gems that I don't
really use on my daywork.

== TODO

=== Short Term
- Member section
- Rent History 
-- should be routed on /rent-history
-- /rent-history should only show history of logged in member
-- Bug: after login - adding to cart failing 
- Make Checkout work
- After check out finish - clear the cart

- Have more data
- After Create Account - should redirect back to front page 
- Category Page
-- Display paginated
- Front page
-- Movies list to be paginated 

- Registration
-- must be easily register

- Rent period
- Use Rspec (and maybe Cucumber)
- Upgrade to latest Rails

=== Longer Term
- Rating System
-- Hook to rotten tomatoes API?
- Front Page
-- Display latest
-- Display most popular
- Admin - maybe using ActiveAdmin
- Member area
-- invoice history
- Use Service Layer - models deriving directly from ActiveRecord should be dumb
- Use Devise for authentication
