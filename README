== Movie Depot - the online movie dispenser

This is a slightly different implementation of the
project from the book Agile Web Development with Rails (4th edition).

== TODO

=== Short Term
- Bug: category page should not be secured
- Front page
-- Browse movie by category
-- Movies list to be paginated 
- Use Rspec (and maybe Cucumber)
- Redo the layout - maybe using Bootstrap
- Upgrade to latest Rails
- Registration
-- must be easily register

=== Longer Term
- Rating System
-- Hook to rotten tomatoes API?
- Front Page
-- Display latest
-- Display most popular
- Admin - maybe using ActiveAdmin
- Member area
-- invoice history
- Use Service Layer - models deriving directly from ActiveRecord should be dumb
