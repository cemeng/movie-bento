== Movie Bento

It's an online movie rental system - it's started off as a variation from
the project from the book Agile Development with Rails (4th edition).    
    
Aim of the project is to test Rails features and other gems that I don't
really use on my daywork.

== TODO

=== Short Term
CHECKOUT IS BROKEN TERRIBLY
- Make Checkout work
- When Register - should not be an admin by default
- After check out finish - clear the cart
- Side bar only for member - admin should be separate
 
- Member section
- Bug - checkout redirect to login
- Have more data
- After Create Account - should redirect back to front page 
- Category Page
-- Display paginated
- Front page
-- Movies list to be paginated 
- Use Rspec (and maybe Cucumber)
- Upgrade to latest Rails
- Registration
-- must be easily register
- Remove login page dump information

=== Longer Term
- Rating System
-- Hook to rotten tomatoes API?
- Front Page
-- Display latest
-- Display most popular
- Admin - maybe using ActiveAdmin
- Member area
-- invoice history
- Use Service Layer - models deriving directly from ActiveRecord should be dumb
- Use Devise for authentication
